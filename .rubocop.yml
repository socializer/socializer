  # What MRI version of the Ruby interpreter is the inspected code intended to
  # run on? (If there is more than one, set this to the lowest version.)
  # If a value is specified for TargetRubyVersion then it is used. Acceptable
  # values are specified as a float (i.e. 3.0); the teeny version of Ruby
  # should not be included. If the project specifies a Ruby version in the
  # .tool-versions or .ruby-version files, Gemfile or gems.rb file, RuboCop will
  # try to determine the desired version of Ruby by inspecting the
  # .tool-versions file first, then .ruby-version, followed by the Gemfile.lock
  # or gems.locked file. (Although the Ruby version is specified in the Gemfile
  # or gems.rb file, RuboCop reads the final value from the lock file.) If the
  # Ruby version is still unresolved, RuboCop will use the oldest officially
  # supported Ruby version (currently Ruby 2.7).
